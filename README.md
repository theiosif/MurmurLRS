# MurmurLRS

**A privacy-focused fork of ExpressLRS with authenticated encryption.**

MurmurLRS encrypts and authenticates every RC packet over the air. Your stick inputs, telemetry, and channel data are protected with AES-128 -- nobody can read your link or inject commands.

## How do I use MurmurLRS?

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/MurmurLRS/releases) or clone this repo
2. Open the [ELRS Configurator](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases)
3. Choose the **Local** tab and point it at the `src` folder
4. Flash your TX and RX with the `MURMUR_ENCRYPT` build flag
5. Set a strong binding phrase on both sides -- it's now your encryption key

That's it. Same hardware, same Configurator, same workflow.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/MurmurLRS
cd MurmurLRS/src

# Build for your target with encryption enabled
pio run -e <your_target> -DMURMUR_ENCRYPT
```

## FAQ

### How's the performance?

Identical to stock ELRS at the same version. AES-128 encryption adds **9 microseconds** per packet -- that's 3 AES block operations. At 250 Hz, total overhead is 0.23% of CPU time. You won't notice it.

| | MurmurLRS | Stock ELRS |
|---|---|---|
| Latency added | ~9 us/packet | -- |
| CPU overhead (250 Hz) | 0.23% | -- |
| Packet size | Same | Same |
| Air rate | Same | Same |
| Range | Same | Same |

### What's different from PrivacyLRS?

Both projects add encryption to ELRS. The difference is **authentication**:

| | MurmurLRS | PrivacyLRS |
|---|---|---|
| Encryption | AES-128-CTR | ChaCha20 |
| Packet authentication | AES-CMAC (keyed MAC) | CRC only (not keyed) |
| Bit-flip resistance | Tampered packets rejected | Vulnerable (stream cipher is malleable) |
| Replay protection | 64-packet sliding window | 8-bit counter (wraps at 256) |
| Key derivation | AES-CMAC KDF | Binding phrase direct |
| Overhead | ~9 us/pkt | ~3.5 us/pkt |

PrivacyLRS encrypts with ChaCha20 but doesn't authenticate. That means an attacker can flip bits in your encrypted packets and the receiver silently accepts corrupted data. MurmurLRS uses encrypt-then-MAC -- any tampered packet is rejected.

### Is this compatible with stock ELRS?

No. Both TX and RX must run MurmurLRS. You cannot mix MurmurLRS and stock ELRS devices on the same link.

### What hardware is supported?

Everything ELRS supports -- ESP32, ESP8285, STM32 targets, 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz. Same radios, same modules.

## Status

**Beta -- testers needed.**

The encryption module passes 30 tests including NIST AES-128 vectors and RFC 4493 CMAC test vectors. What it needs is real-world validation:

- [x] Crypto correctness (30/30 tests)
- [x] Zero packet overhead (same air rate, same packet size)
- [ ] Over-the-air TX/RX encrypted link test
- [ ] Range testing (should be identical to stock)
- [ ] Failsafe behavior under encryption
- [ ] Rate switching / reconnection
- [ ] ESP8266 and STM32 target testing

**Set failsafe on your flight controller. Bench test before flying.**

### Run the test suite

```
cd src/lib/MurmurEncrypt
make test
```

```
=== MurmurLRS Crypto Test Suite ===
[AES-128 ECB]           3/3  PASS
[AES-CMAC (RFC 4493)]   4/4  PASS

## Binding phrase = encryption key

In stock ELRS, the binding phrase is just for pairing -- it's not a security feature. In MurmurLRS, the binding phrase is fed through an AES-CMAC key derivation function to produce your encryption key.

**Use a strong phrase.** 3-4 random words minimum. Same phrase on TX and RX.

## How it works

MurmurLRS replaces the CRC field with authenticated encryption. Zero extra bytes, same packet structure:

```
TX:  RC data -> AES-128-CTR encrypt -> AES-CMAC -> MAC replaces CRC -> transmit
RX:  receive -> verify MAC -> decrypt -> replay check -> RC output
```

SYNC packets remain unencrypted for connection establishment.

**Cryptographic primitives:**
- AES-128-CTR for encryption (NIST SP 800-38A)
- AES-128-CMAC for authentication (RFC 4493)
- AES-CMAC KDF for key derivation
- 32-bit counter reconstructed from 8-bit OtaNonce
- 64-packet sliding window replay protection

**Key derivation:**
```
binding_phrase -> AES-CMAC(zeros, phrase) -> master_key
master_key -> AES-CMAC(master, "murmur-enc") -> encryption_key (16 bytes)
master_key -> AES-CMAC(master, "murmur-uid") -> UID (6 bytes, ELRS compatible)
```

**Files changed from stock ELRS:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/MurmurEncrypt/*` | New: encryption module (~500 LOC pure C) |
| `src/lib/OTA/OTA.cpp` | Wraps CRC functions with encrypt/decrypt |
| `src/src/tx_main.cpp` | 4 lines: init encryption at boot |
| `src/src/rx_main.cpp` | 4 lines: init encryption at boot |

The encryption module is pure C with no external dependencies. ~1 KB code size. Tested against NIST and RFC reference vectors.

**Known limitations (v1):**
- 14-bit MAC gives forgery probability of 1/16384 per attempt
- SYNC packets are cleartext (needed for initial connection)
- No forward secrecy -- same key per session
- LCG hop sequence is inherited from ELRS

## About ExpressLRS

ExpressLRS is an open-source radio control link for RC applications. It supports Semtech SX127x/SX1280 hardware across 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands with packet rates up to 1000 Hz. MurmurLRS is a fork that adds encryption on top of this foundation.

See [README_ELRS.md](README_ELRS.md) for the original ExpressLRS documentation.
